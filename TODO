* don't mutate declaration statements?
* turn ControlFlowRenderer into a data structure creator
    * store ControlBlocks instead of just names for outgoing
    * also store keep incoming edges
    * prune more empty blocks:
        ```
        int a() {
            if (a) {
                ;
            }
        }
        ```
        ```
        void a() {
            while (d) {
                while (c) {
                    ;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
