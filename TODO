* don't mutate declaration statements?

* AbstractMutator: iteration tracking?

* Pattern ideas:
    * common-sub-expression elimination
    * rewrite array accesses to same index with temporary local variable

* Logger
    * Log to console and to file in execDir
    * If execDir is not yet set up, cache the log lines until notified about it
