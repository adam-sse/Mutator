* don't mutate declaration statements?

* AbstractMutator: iteration tracking?

* Pattern ideas:
    * common-sub-expression elimination
        - improve
            -> type detection: more than BasicType
            -> re-search for expressions? (may be needed due to previous modifications)
    * rewrite array accesses to same index with temporary local variable

* LoopUnrolling
    * Improve detection?
